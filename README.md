# Google-Play-The-Android-App-Market-
<p>This project lets you apply Data Manipulation skills with pandas. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">data</a> for this project was scrapped from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en">Google play</a> website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>apps.csv</code>: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.</li>
<li><code>user_reviews.csv</code>: contains 100 reviews for each app, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/21/google-play-stores-redesigned-ratings-and-reviews-section-lets-you-easily-filter-by-star-rating/">most helpful first</a>. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.</li>
</ul>
